# MovingObjects.github.io

## Practice moving objects using JavaScript

## Description:
Here is a pattern using circles that I created to move a circle in and out of place.
 
## Installation: 
I used the pattern and shapes I created when practicing shapes. Then I set one of the circles to move in and out of place.

## Usage:
You can not do much with this page. I created it to practice moving objects on a page. 

## Support: N/A

## Roadmap: 
I will continue to work with this pattern until I get all of the circles to move in and out of place.
